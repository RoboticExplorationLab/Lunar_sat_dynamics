# Lunar_sat_dynamics
Implementation of the dynamics of a satellite orbiting the Moon. Includes multiple lunar gravity field models and some numerical simulations as examples
To run a simulation, just use run_sim(x_0, Δt, t_{final}) where x_0 is the initial condition in the form [r_0; v_0] with r_0 and v_0 being an inertial frame 3D position and velocity vector Δt is the time step for numerical integration and t_{final} the desired duration of the simulation
